## Java Native SSH (jsch) Examples

### NOTE: Source and Examples coming in the next few days!!

### Overview
Before taking the time to figure out the jsch library, I was naively invoking
plink.exe to SSH into remote machines. This worked and all, but it just felt
extremely clunky.

In this repository, I will have examples on how to use the jsch library to give
Java a native SSH option. Unfortunately jsch doesn't have great documentation
at this momemnt, so it's somewhat difficult to figure out what one needs and
how this library works. I'm hoping I will be able to relieve some of this
frustration.
